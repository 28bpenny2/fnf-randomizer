# Friday Night Funkin Randomizer
This is an unofficial mod for Friday Night Funkin that randomizes notes for all songs and difficulties. 

Play and download Friday Night Funkin here: https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin and support the developers here: https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin

## Requirements
You will need Python 3.7+ to run the program. Install the most recent version of Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to download the latest version of Friday Night Funkin (v4). This download can be found at the game's itchio page linked above. It is heavily recommended that you use a clean build and not your own build! Always good to have a backup just in case things go wrong.

## Installation and Instructions
Download and place the fnf-randomizer.py file inside the root Friday Night Funkin directory (the same directory that the executable is in). With Python 3.7+ installed on the same computer, run the python executable by double-clicking it or running it through cmd using the command:

`python fnf-randomizer.py`

When running the program you should be greeted by a few options to select:

- Randomize Notes: Randomizes what notes need to be pressed
- Randomize Characters: Randomizes what characters appear on each map
- Randomize Order: Randomizes who plays what section (Not Recommended!)

Once the program is finished running, the patch should be complete and you should be able to open the game and enjoy a randomized experience

## Troubleshooting
Q. The python executable won't run when I double-click it!

A. Make sure that Python is the default program to open .py files. If this still does not work, running the program through the cmd as explained above should work.

Q. There are double notes on some maps!

A. Unfortunately with how the maps are written that's difficult to avoid. It's possible that in a future version of this project that the problem will be fixed.

Q. I'm running into an undocumented problem or error!

A. Let me know! Either leave an issue on this repo or send me an email at natestutte@protonmail.com.
